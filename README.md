A secure CLI tool to generate paper wallets for multiple cryptocurrencies: **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Solana**, and **Chainlink**.

Built with [Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) - the most popular Node.js CLI framework.

## 📖 What is a Paper Wallet?

A **paper wallet** is a physical document containing your cryptocurrency addresses and private keys, stored completely offline. Think of it as printing out your bank account information, but with cryptographic keys instead.

### Why "Paper"?

The name refers to the **storage method**, not the addresses themselves:

```
Digital Keys → Written/Printed on Paper → "Paper Wallet"
```

### Types of Crypto Storage:

| Type                | Storage          | Example            | Online? |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| **Hot Wallet**      | Software, Online | MetaMask, Coinbase | ✅ Yes  |
| **Hardware Wallet** | USB Device       | Ledger, Trezor     | ❌ No   |
| **Paper Wallet**    | Physical Paper   | BitPaper output    | ❌ No   |

### Benefits:

- ✅ **100% offline** - Immune to hacking
- ✅ **No electronics** - Can't fail or corrupt
- ✅ **Long-term storage** - Works for decades
- ✅ **No batteries** - Unlike hardware wallets
- ✅ **Low cost** - Just paper and ink

### Drawbacks:

- ⚠️ Physical damage (fire, water, deterioration)
- ⚠️ Can be lost or stolen (like cash)
- ⚠️ Not convenient for frequent transactions
- ⚠️ Must manually type keys when spending

## 🔐 How Cryptocurrency Addresses Work

### The Key Concept: Math, Not Registration

**Important:** Cryptocurrency addresses are generated using **pure mathematics** - they don't need to be "registered" on the blockchain!

```
Traditional Banking:
Bank assigns you account number → Stored in bank database → Now you can receive money

Cryptocurrency:
You generate address with math → No database entry → Can receive crypto immediately
```

### What BitPaper Does:

```typescript
1. Generate Random Number (256 bits of entropy)
   ↓
2. Create Mnemonic Seed Phrase (24 words)
   ↓
3. Derive Keys Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   ↓
4. Generate Public Key from Private Key (one-way math)
   ↓
5. Hash Public Key to Create Address (more one-way math)
```

**All of this happens locally on your computer. No internet. No blockchain interaction.**

### When Does the Blockchain Get Involved?

The blockchain **only** knows about your address when:

#### ✅ Someone Sends You Funds:

```
Before first transaction:
- Your address exists: Only in your wallet
- Blockchain record: None (address is "invisible")

After first transaction:
- Transaction broadcast to network
- Blockchain records: "0.001 BTC sent to YOUR_ADDRESS"
- Now your address appears on blockchain with balance
```

#### ✅ You Spend Funds:

```
You sign transaction with private key
→ Broadcast to network
→ Blockchain verifies signature matches address
→ Transaction processed
```

### Are These Real Addresses?

**YES! 100% real.** Here's why:

1. **Mathematically Valid** - Generated using the same cryptographic standards as hardware wallets
2. **Blockchain-Ready** - Will be accepted immediately when first used
3. **Industry Standard Libraries** - Uses the same code as MetaMask, Ledger, and Trezor
4. **Can Hold Real Value** - Send real cryptocurrency to them and it will be there

### The Address Space is HUGE

```
Bitcoin addresses: 2^160 = ~1.4 × 10^48 possible addresses
Ethereum addresses: 2^160 = ~1.4 × 10^48 possible addresses
Solana addresses: 2^256 = ~1.15 × 10^77 possible addresses

For comparison:
- Atoms in human body: ~7 × 10^27
- Stars in observable universe: ~10^24
- Grains of sand on Earth: ~7.5 × 10^18
```

There are more Bitcoin addresses than atoms in a million human bodies!

### Could Someone Else Generate the Same Address?

**Technically yes, but practically... NEVER.**

```
Probability of collision: ~1 in 10^48

You're more likely to:
✓ Win the lottery 6 times in a row
✓ Be struck by lightning 10 times in one day
✓ Find a specific atom in the universe

To get 50% chance of ONE collision:
- Need to generate: 2^80 addresses (1.2 septillion)
- At 1 billion/second: Would take 38 BILLION years
- Age of universe: 13.8 billion years

Historical evidence:
- Bitcoin launched: 2009
- Addresses generated: Billions+
- Collisions found: ZERO
```

**The cryptographic security of address generation is rock solid!** This is why wallets can generate addresses offline without checking if they "already exist."

## 📖 How to Use Generated Wallets

### Receiving Funds

1. Use the **Address** to receive funds
2. **Share using QR Code** - Scan with wallet apps instead of typing manually
3. Share the address publicly - it's safe
4. Test with a small amount first

### Using QR Codes

Each address includes a **scannable QR code** that makes receiving funds easier:

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No typing errors
- ✅ Fast and convenient
- ✅ Works with all major wallet apps
- ✅ Can be scanned from printed paper wallets

**How to use:**

1. Open your wallet app (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)
2. Select "Send" or "Transfer"
3. Click "Scan QR Code"
4. Point your camera at the QR code on your paper wallet
5. Confirm the transaction

**For printing:**

- QR codes print clearly on paper
- Use high-quality printer for best results
- Test scanning before storing away

### Sending Funds

You'll need the **Private Key**:

**Bitcoin:**

- Import the WIF or private key into any Bitcoin wallet
- Recommended: Bitcoin Core, Electrum, or hardware wallets

**Ethereum & Chainlink:**

- Import private key into MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, or similar
- For LINK: Add the token contract to your wallet

**Solana:**

- Import private key into Phantom, Solflare, or similar
- Or use the CLI: `solana-keygen recover`

### Using the Seed Phrase

Instead of individual private keys, you can restore ALL wallets using the 24-word mnemonic:

- Bitcoin: Use BIP44 path `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`
- Ethereum: Use BIP44 path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- Solana: Use first 32 bytes of seed

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Before Generation

1. **Disconnect from internet** - Run on an offline computer
2. **Use a clean system** - Preferably a live USB OS like Tails
3. **Verify the code** - Review the source before running

### During Generation

1. **Write down immediately** - Have paper and pen ready
2. **Double-check** - Verify you wrote everything correctly
3. **Don't take photos** - Never digitally photograph private keys

### After Generation

1. **Store securely** - Use a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
2. **Make multiple copies** - Store in different secure locations
3. **Test with small amounts** - Verify everything works before large transfers
4. **Delete digital files** - Securely wipe any generated files:
   ```bash
   shred -vfz -n 10 wallets.txt
   ```

### Long-term Storage

1. **Use archival paper** - Won't degrade over time
2. **Consider metal** - Engrave keys on steel plates for fire/water resistance
3. **Protect from elements** - Keep dry and away from heat/light
4. **Plan inheritance** - Consider how heirs will access (secure instructions)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Don't generate wallets on an online computer
2. ❌ Don't store private keys in cloud storage
3. ❌ Don't take screenshots or photos
4. ❌ Don't email private keys to yourself
5. ❌ Don't use the same wallet for multiple purposes
6. ❌ Don't forget to make backup copies
7. ❌ Don't throw away the paper - it's your only access!

## 🧪 Testing

Always test with small amounts first:

1. Generate a wallet
2. Send a small test amount to the address
3. Verify you can see the balance
4. Try sending the test amount back
5. Only then use for larger amounts
